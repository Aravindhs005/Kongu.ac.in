  "about": "Food Technology is a branch of engineering that focuses on the processing, preservation, and quality enhancement of food products to ensure safety, nutrition, and sustainability. It integrates principles of microbiology, chemistry, biotechnology, and engineering to develop innovative techniques for food production, packaging, and distribution. Food technologists work on advanced technologies such as food fortification, smart packaging, automation, and sustainable food processing to improve shelf life, taste, and nutritional value. With the growing demand for safe, healthy, and eco-friendly food solutions, the field continues to evolve, addressing challenges like food security, waste reduction, and alternative protein sources. As the global food industry advances, Food Technology plays a vital role in enhancing food quality, safety, and sustainability for a healthier future.",

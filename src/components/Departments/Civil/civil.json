  "about": "Civil Engineering is a branch of engineering that focuses on the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of infrastructure. It integrates elements of structural, geotechnical, environmental, transportation, and water resources engineering to develop safe and sustainable built environments. Civil engineers work on various projects, including bridges, roads, buildings, dams, and urban planning, ensuring durability, efficiency, and safety. With rapid advancements in construction materials and technology, the field is evolving towards smart infrastructure, incorporating sustainable and resilient designs to address climate challenges. As the demand for modern and eco-friendly cities increases, civil engineering continues to drive innovation in infrastructure, enhancing functionality, sustainability, and societal impact.",
